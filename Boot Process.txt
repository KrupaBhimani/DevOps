Boot Process
Step 1: power on
Step 2: BIOS
   * Perform system integrity check                 
                
   * Search, load, execute bootloader program for hard drive
         
Step 3: MBR (master boot record)
   * Three         sections (primary bootloader, partition table info, MBR validation                 check)
                 
   * Less than 512 bytes size
                 
   * Located in bootable disk
                 
   * Contain info about grab
                 
   * Loads and executes grab boot loader
         
Step 4: GRUB
      * You can choose which kernel image execute
                 
      * Display splash screen
                 
      * Loads default kernel image
         
Step 5: Kernel
         * Executes init program located in /sbin/init
                 
         * Loads file system and execute first program
         
Step 6: init
            * Decides he linux runlevels
                 
            * Runlevels are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
         
Step 7: run level
               * S and K Scripts
                 
               * S -> Startup Scripts
                 
               * K -> Stopping scripts
