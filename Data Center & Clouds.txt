Data Center & Clouds


Traditional Computing components: 
* Hardware
* OS
* Application


What is cloud computing? 
* It is an on -demand service of compute resources, storage and computing power over the internet.


Cloud Service Models
1. IAAS (Infrastructure as a service)
   1. Virtual hardware that replaces physical
   2. Can scale up or down based on needs
   3. Pay what you use
   4. Provides resources for high performance computing
   5. Examples: contain compute, block storage and network
2. PAAS (Platform as a Service)
   1. Add OS and software
   2. Provides runtime environment
   3. Allows developers to focus an apps
   4. Provides load balancing and auto scaling
   5. Examples: object storage, identity management(user authentication), database
3. SAAS (Software as a Service)
   1. Apps are accessed over internet
   2. Largest used in three models
   3. Works on monthly fee
   4. Examples: monitoring, content, communication


Cloud Deployment model:
1. Public Cloud: 
   1. Whatever client want, he gets
   2. Scale up and down
   3. Operated by third party companies. Example; AWS, Azure, Gcloud
   4. Pay as you go
2. Private Cloud(on premises):
   1. Purchase virtualize software
   2. Set up individual clouds
   3. Limited scalability
   4. Advantage: Control all of its own security
3. Hybrid cloud:
   1. Combination of both public and private clouds
   2. Tight control of data
   3. Feature of both
4. Community Cloud:
   1. Used for organization
   2. Less Scalability & flexibility


Characteristics of Cloud
* Elastic: grow and shrink as client need
* Resource pooling
* Rapid elasticity
* Self service: access any resources any time
* Scalability: use few or more resources
* Broad network access
* Pay as you go
* Availability: resources are available when client needs


Networking:


* RDP: remote desktop protocol (used to access windows instance)
* SSH: Secure shell (used for linux instance)
* VPN: is a secure and private network connection that occurs through public network
* Direct connection: direct physical connection to your company network & cloud provider
* Load balancing: for example: balance load of the website by distributing request to multiple servers
   * Benefits: performance, scalability, reliability
* DNS: DNS will provides IP add of domain


 Cloud Storage


Benefit: 
* easy file access
* Easy sharing
* redundancy(back up)
* Very cheap
Feature: 
* Scalability
* Transparency
* Standard user interface


Example: dropbox, icloud,one drive, Google drive 


Storage Type:


1. File Storage:
   1. Windows based system
2. Block Storage:
   1. Allows files to be broken into more manageable chunks
   2. Great for large structured data that needs to be updated frequently
3. Object Storage: 
   1. Object level storage
   2. It contain data, metadata tag, object attributes
4. CDN (content delivery network)
   1. Allows user from remote location to access data on nearby server than the original server
   2. Benefits: 
      1. Increased website performance
      2. Increased website reliability
      3. Greater resource scalability
