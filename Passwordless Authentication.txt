Passwordless Authentication


* It is a kind of authentication method in which a user can login without a password. User has to complete the authentication process by providing secure proof through a register device.
* In this method public key and private key would be used to authenticate.
* Public key: it is a long random stream of bits which is derivative of a private key.
* Private key: long random stream of bits, kept secret never leaves the client.
* You can generate the public key from the private key but cannot do the opposite thing.
* In passwordless authentication, the public key is provided to servers,websites etc. and the private key is in the user's device.


How is MFA different from passwordless authentication?
* MFA is an added layer of security on password based authentication.


Steps for passwordless authentication:


Step 1: create ssh keypair from following command:


Ssh -keygen -t rsa


Here -t means type 
* Enter the location where you want to store it. Enter the path.
* Verify you have successfully created a key pair.
Ls ~/.ssh.id/*


Step 2: upload public key to remote server
* To enable passwordless access you have to upload a copy of the public key to the server under the .ssh directory as a file name ‘authorized_keys’.


Ssh-copy-id [remote_username]@[server ip add]


Step 3: Login without password
Ssh [remote_username]@[server ip add]


Scenario of passwordless authentication:
This client has both public and private keys. And the server will have only a public key.


1. Client ask server to connect
2. Server acknowledges with encrypted message using public key.
3. Client decrypts the message using a private key.
Connection established.
